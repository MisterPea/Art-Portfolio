Todo:
#### CMS - Pure React
* [ ] Find all relevant thumbnail folder/images
* [ ] Download current thumbnails
* [ ] Deleting thumbnails deletes image
* [ ] Allow remaking of existing thumbnail (might be able to save thumbnail creation data from HTML Canvas)
* [ ] Upload image/choose thumbnail/upload thumbnail
* [ ] Drag-drop reorder of thumbnails
* [ ] Will exist as a subdomain...updating site will trigger a rebuild via GitHub Actions maybe through [`repository_dispatch`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68147899/whats-is-the-difference-between-repository-dispatch-and-workflow-dispatch-in-git)
